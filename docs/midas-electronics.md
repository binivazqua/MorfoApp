# Midas Prosthetic Arm â€“ Electronics and Signal Processing

## Components
The Midas prosthetic arm operates through an advanced combination of **microcontrollers** and **sensors**. The systemâ€™s core consists of three boards in charge of processing analog signals from the **electromyographic sensor**, which captures muscle activity from the userâ€™s forearm.

## Process

### Analog signal interpretation
The core board is responsible for processing analog signals received from the AD8232 electromyographic sensor. This sensor captures muscle activity from the userâ€™s forearm, converting the biological signals into data that the prosthetic can interpret.

###  Analog signal Filtering
These signals are then passed on to the arm processing board. This microcontroller applies a secondary filtering process to the signals, analyzing their intensity and duration to determine the userâ€™s intent.
